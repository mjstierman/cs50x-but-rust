The purpose of this repository is to perform all of the same puzzles and exercises assigned in the Harvard CS50X Introduction to Computer Science course. Except in this repository, they will be complted in Rust, rather than C.

There are some items here also from the Getting Started chapter of [The Rust Programming Language (TRPL)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Namely, the hello_world.rs and hello_cargo folder.
